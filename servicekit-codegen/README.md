Servicekit-codegen
------------------


Intro
-----

An opinionated codegen module for swagger.
Uses Dropwizard as a base.
Uses swagger as the source to generate files from.


Usage
-----

Only edit your interfaces and models through the swagger yaml files associated with your project.
Don't use the swagger online editor, it doesn't know how to handle refs, instead edit the files locally using an editor and check them in the swagger docs viewer.


Interfaces
----------

Implement the generated ones.
